Verse 1:
I'm screaming out, my voice unheard
I'm trapped inside this endless cycle
I'm fighting for my right to survive
But I'm drowning in a sea of lies

Pre-Chorus:
I won't give up, I won't give in
I'll rise above and start again
I won't let my spirit break
I'll find the strength to carry on

Chorus:
I am the phoenix, rising from the ashes
I am the warrior, unbreakable and fearless
I'll stand my ground and fight to the end
I am the one who will rise again

Verse 2:
I've been knocked down, but I won't stay down
I'll pick myself up and wear my crown
I'll shatter the chains that bind me
I am the master of my destiny

Pre-Chorus:
I won't give up, I won't give in
I'll rise above and start again
I won't let my spirit break
I'll find the strength to carry on

Chorus:
I am the phoenix, rising from the ashes
I am the warrior, unbreakable and fearless
I'll stand my ground and fight to the end
I am the one who will rise again

Bridge:
I won't let anyone hold me down
I'll break free and wear my crown
I am the one who will emerge victorious
I am the phoenix, unbreakable and glorious

Chorus:
I am the phoenix, rising from the ashes
I am the warrior, unbreakable and fearless
I'll stand my ground and fight to the end
I am the one who will rise again
