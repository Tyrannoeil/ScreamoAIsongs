Verse 1:
Rage and fury burning inside
I can't escape the pain I hide
I'm consumed by the fire
My heart is a burning pyre

Chorus:
I am the bringer of the end
I am the destroyer, my power never bends
I'll tear down the walls and shatter the gates
I am the one who determines your fate

Verse 2:
I'm a warrior, I'll fight to the death
I'll never submit, I'll catch my breath
I'll rise from the ashes and take my place
I am the one who will end this race

Chorus:
I am the bringer of the end
I am the destroyer, my power never bends
I'll tear down the walls and shatter the gates
I am the one who determines your fate

Bridge:
I won't back down, I won't retreat
I'll stand my ground and face the heat
I am the one who will emerge victorious
I am the destroyer, unbreakable and glorious

Chorus:
I am the bringer of the end
I am the destroyer, my power never bends
I'll tear down the walls and shatter the gates
I am the one who determines your fate
